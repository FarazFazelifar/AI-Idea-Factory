# AI-Idea-Factory
Week 1: The AI Idea Factory 🏭💡
For my inaugural project, I'm diving headfirst into the world of multi-agent AI systems. I'm building an "AI Idea Factory" – a collaborative network of AI agents designed to fuel my creative process throughout this year-long challenge.
Here's a sneak peek at the dream team:

- 🔍 The Researcher: Scouring the latest in AI advancements
- 🎨 The Creative Director: Spinning research into innovative project ideas
- 📊 The Project Manager: Keeping everything on track
- ✏️ The Planner: Breaking big ideas into actionable steps
- ✍️ The Writer: Crafting compelling content about each project
- 👀 The Content Reviewer: Ensuring top-notch quality in our communications

Together, these agents will work in harmony to generate, plan, and document each week's AI project, creating a self-sustaining cycle of innovation.
I'm building this system using cutting-edge tools like CrewAI and Ollama, pushing the boundaries of what's possible with current AI technologies.

To use this project for yourself, first, install the required dependencies using ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```and then simply follow the instructions in the notebook.
You have to have Ollama installed and at least one model pulled.
An example output of the system is also available for you to check out! (On my machine, generating this output took 58 minutes!)
Hope you have fun and happy coding!
